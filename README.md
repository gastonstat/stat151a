## 1. Introduction

:speaker: __ABOUT__: By the end of this introductory module, you will be able to:

- Define what a linear model is (in what sense a model is said to be linear)
- Describe the high-level intuition of regression (and the regression function)


:book: __READING__: 
- Preliminary concepts

## 2. Simple Regression

:speaker: __ABOUT__: In this week, we introduce the descriptive aspects of a Simple Linear Regression model. This involves postponing the discussion of inferential aspects for later. In particular, we will focus on the method of (Ordinary) Least Squares to obtain the estimated coefficients of a simple linear model. Likewise, we'll discuss the geometric aspects of OLS, and understand how the Gauss-Markov assumptions wrap a linear model with a first layer of "soft" statistical assumptions.

- Geometry of simple regression
- Gauss-Markov assumptions in simple regression
